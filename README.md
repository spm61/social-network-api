  ## Description:
  This creates a basic API for a social media application using MongoDB and Mongoose.  There's no front-end functionality, just the models, controllers, and routes that interface with the local database.

  ## Installation:
  Make sure that node is installed on your machine.  Then clone the git repo so you have the files locally.  You'll also have to have MongoDB installed, and then create a database called social-media-db using it.  This repo does not come with data seeds, you'll have to create the data yourselff.

  ## Usage:
  Using an application like insomnia, make requests to the database to create, modify, or delete users, thoughts, or reactions.
  The url's to use all begin with localhost:3001 and have the following forms with the following available methods:
  /api/users - GET
  /api/users/:userId - POST, PUT, DELETE
  /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId - POST, DELETE
  /api/thoughts - GET, POST
  /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/ - PUT, DELETE
  /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions - POST
  /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/:reactId - DELETE

  All the Ids are generated by Mongo, so you'll have to make GET Requests on the users or thoughts route in order to see them.  

  ## Contribution:
